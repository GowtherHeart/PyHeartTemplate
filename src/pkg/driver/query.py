class Query:
    """Base class for executing database queries using a specified driver.

    This class provides a framework for executing queries with parameters and handling
    exceptions. It supports both single and array results, and allows for custom exception
    handling and result transformation using a model class.

    Attributes:
        query (str): The SQL query to be executed.
        param (Sequence): The parameters to be used in the query.
        driver (PostgresDriver): The database driver used to execute the query.
        model (Any): The model class used to transform query results.
        array (bool): Flag indicating if the result should be an array of models.
        skip (bool): Flag indicating if result transformation should be skipped.
        catch_exception (list[Exception] | None): List of exceptions to catch during execution.
        return_exception (Exception | None): Exception to raise if a caught exception occurs.

    Methods:
        __init__(*args): Initializes the query with the given parameters.
        _execute(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for executing the query.
        execute(): Executes the query and handles exceptions and result transformation.
